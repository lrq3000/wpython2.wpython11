This is WPython (codename "CISCy") v1.1, which is based on
Python 2.6.4.

WPython is a re-implementation of (some parts of) Python, which drops
support for bytecode in favour of a word-based model (where a is word is
16 bits wide).

It also implements an hybrid stack-register virtual machine, and adds a of
other optimizations.

For better informations, take a look at the slides which I have presented to
the last PyCon3 at Florence, in Italy, for WPython 1.0 (alpha). They explain the new architecture
and give some informations about the optimizations.
In the next PyCon(4) at Florence, in Italy, I'll explain the changes on WPython 1.1.

What's new in this release?
---------------------------

1.1

Added a lot of more optimizations ranging in several areas.

Introduced also a brand new superinstructions family to handle smallints
(8 bits integer ranging from 0 to 255).


What's in old releases?
-----------------------

1.0 

An almost complete replacement for CPython 2.6.4.

Only Docs/dis.rst needs to be updated to the new wordcode structure for
opcodes. It'll be done after opcodes do not change anymore.


Distribution structure
----------------------

Same of Python 2.6.4. Only one folder ("codestats") added to Tools, with two
applications that I have used to generate stats to the bytecode (or wordcode)
generated from Lib or Tools folders in the standard library.
Anyway, you can specify files and/or folders to be processed instead, listing
them in the command line.  

That's all, folks!
